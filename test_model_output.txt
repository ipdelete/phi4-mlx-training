Test 1: Explain the concept of machine learning in simple terms.
--------------------------------------------------
==========
Machine learning is when our computers learn from experience by looking at examples of things that have already been done, and then apply that knowledge to new situations. For example, if we want to teach a computer to recognize cats, we can show it many pictures of cats and tell it "this is a cat", and it will eventually be able to recognize when it sees a cat in a picture.<|end|>
